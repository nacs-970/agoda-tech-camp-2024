# How to Create a LINE Bot

1. Log in to LINE at the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/en/)
2. Click on "Create a new provider" and fill in the required information _(If you already have a provider, you can skip this step)_
3. Click on "Create a new channel" and select "Messaging API"
4. Click on "Create a LINE Official Account.
5. Fill in the required information and click "Create".
6. Once you reach 3rd Step of creating Channel, scroll down and click "Later".
7. Click "Settings" at the top right corner.
8. Click "Messaging API", and then click "Enable Messaging API"
9. Select the provider that we just created from 1.
10. In "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use" page, go ahead and click "OK"
11. Go back to [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console)
12. Select the channel you just created
13. In Basic settings, click issue "Channel secret"
14. In Messaging API, click issue "Channel access token"

At this point, you have created your LINE Bot, but you need to complete some additional settings.

We will come back to config our bot later.
